[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/renan/cakephp-xhprof/v/stable.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/renan/cakephp-xhprof)


Plugin that quickly enables XHProf profiling for your CakePHP application.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.3+
* CakePHP 2.3+
* XHProf

## Installation
First, make sure you enabled the xhprof extension and downloaded [phacility/xhprof](https://github.com/phacility/xhprof).

### Manual

1. Download http://github.com/renan/CakePHP-XHProf/zipball/master
2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. Move the contents to `Plugin/XHProf`

### Git Submodule

```bash
git submodule add git://github.com/renan/CakePHP-XHProf.git Plugin/XHProf
git submodule update --init
```

### Git Clone

```bash
git clone git://github.com/renan/CakePHP-XHProf.git Plugin/XHProf
```

### Composer / Packagist

Extra information can be found at [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/renan/cakephp-xhprof).

This would install the latest 0.1 version to `Plugin/XHProf`:

```json
{
	"require": {
		"renan/cakephp-xhprof": "0.1.*"
	}
}
```
You might want to use "require-dev" if you only plan to use this for development.

## Configuration

The basic configuration consists of loading the plugin and pointing where the `xhprof_lib` directory is located on your system.

On your `Config/bootstrap.php` file:

```php
// Load XHProf Plugin
CakePlugin::load('XHProf');

// XHProf Configuration
Configure::write('XHProf', array(
	'library' => '/usr/local/Cellar/php54-xhprof/270b75d/xhprof_lib',
));
```

Options:

* `library`: Path to your xhprof_lib directory (required)
* `namespace`: Namespace to save your xhprof runs, default is your application directory name
* `flags`: Flags passed over to profiler, default is `0`. For a list of flags visit: http://php.net/xhprof.constants.php
* `ignored_functions`: Array of functions to ignore, default is `call_user_func` and `call_user_func_array`
* `replaceRunId`: Placeholder used to replace the run id in order to display a link in the page, set `false` to disable, default is `%XHProfRunId%`. Read the usage for more information

All options example:

```php
Configure::write('XHProf', array(
	'library' => '/usr/local/Cellar/php54-xhprof/270b75d/xhprof_lib',
	'namespace' => 'myapp',
	'flags' => XHPROF_FLAGS_CPU | XHPROF_FLAGS_MEMORY,
	'ignored_functions' => array(
		'my_function',
		'my_other_function',
	),
	'replaceRunId' => false,
));
```

## Usage

### Dispatcher Filter

Just include the `XHProfDispatcher` in your dispatcher filters list on `Config/bootstrap.php`:

```php
Configure::write('Dispatcher.filters.xhprof', 'XHProf.XHProfDispatcher');
```

By default it will try to replace `%XHProfRunId%` with the saved run id from the page's output.
It allows you to include a link to the xhprof report on the page.

On your `View/Layouts/default.ctp`:

```php
$url = sprintf(
	'/url/to/xhprof_html/index.php?run=%s&source=%s',
	Configure::read('XHProf.replaceRunId'),
	Configure::read('XHProf.namespace')
);
echo $this->Html->link('XHProf Output', $url);
```

#### DebugKit Panel
If you are using [DebugKit](https://github.com/cakephp/debug_kit), you can use the provided panel here.

Make sure you include html config of the URL endpoint of the xhprof_html folder:
```php
Configure::write('XHProf', array(
	'library' => '/usr/local/Cellar/php54-xhprof/270b75d/xhprof_lib',
	'html' => 'http://path/to/xhprof_html',
));
```

Then you can add the panel in your DebugKit components setup:
```php
public $components = array(
	'DebugKit.Toolbar' => array(
		'panels' => array('XHProf.XHProf')
	),
);
```

Done. It should now display the new panel with the link to the result of this page output.

### Manual

This method is very useful when profiling specific points on your code.
For that, just use the `XHProf` class to assist you.

Example:

```php
// Declare the class location
App::uses('XHProf', 'XHProf.Lib');

// Start the profiler
XHProf::start();

// ... your application code

// Stop the profiler
// 1. Returning the profiler data
$data = XHProf::stop();

// 2. or Save the profiler data, returning the run id
$runId = XHProf::finish();
```

_Note_: There are two ways to stop the profiler as explained above. However only one can be used at each run.
